This site is the endpoint of a pipeline that processes 300K+ NFL plays into insights about player and team
performance. Navigate to see predictions about weekly matchups, player performance, and playoff outcomes.

To convert this raw data into actionable insights about future NFL matchups, I have developed a pipeline that 
(1) queries and cleans ESPN API data, (2) generalizes plays into smoothed probability density functions, and 
(3) uses Monte Carlo Simulation to derive estimates of future performance. Predictions are made using a Naive
Bayesian approach, meaning that the effects of individual factors such as field positon, time remaining, and 
injuries (for example) on single-play outcomes would be assumed to be independent.

Note that all predictions are <strong>fully automated</strong> and do not represent my personal opinion.

<p>•   How likely are the Cinicinnati Bengals to make the playoffs? >> <a href="/home/playoffs">HERE</a>
•   How many rush attempts should we expect from Aaron Jones this week? >> <a href="/simulations/player?id=3042519&active_col=Rush ATT">HERE</a>
•   How likely is Lamar Jackson to throw two or more interceptions? >> <a href="/simulations/player?id=3916387&active_col=INT">HERE</a>
•   Which teams are the strongest picks to win this week? >> <a href="/home/Weekly Predictions">HERE</a>

<h2>Reading the Swarm Plots</h2>
<p>To illustrate how randomized game simulations are used to make predictions, I've employed a kind of interactive
chart called a swarm plot. Each circle in these plots represents an individual simulation, of which the first 
1,000 out of 10,000 total simulations are displayed. While it's too computationally demanding to render all 10,000 
games in a single chart, the full set of simulations is used to produce probability estimates.</p>

<p>For each statistical category, the frozen vertical line demarcatess the sample mean of the full dataset (10,000
simulations). To find the probability of reaching a statistical threshold (i.e. passing yards > 300), select the 
relevant stat from the blue dropdown and move your mouse to that point along the horizontal axis. The percentage 
values above the axis represent the odds of the statistic falling above or below the set threshold.
